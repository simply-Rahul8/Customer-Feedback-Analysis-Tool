The function achieves its purpose and produces clear, predictable output. There are, however, some areas where the implementation could be made more maintainable. Using any[] reduces type safety, so defining interfaces for User and FormattedUser would help prevent issues later. The loop can be replaced with .map() to simplify the structure and better communicate the transformation being performed. The date calculation is recreated for each iteration, and placing it outside the loop would make the code slightly cleaner. The use of signupDate.split("T")[0] depends on a fixed format, so a more stable date-handling approach may be beneficial. The logic that determines whether a user is active could also be extracted into a helper function for improved readability. A few considerations remain, such as how to handle missing date fields, how “active” should be defined, and whether names should always be merged. The existing logic is understandable, and the returned data format is clear, giving the function a solid base that can be refined further.
